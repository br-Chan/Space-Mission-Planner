# Space-Mission-Planner
A project to revise the design patterns of Factory, Builder, Prototype, Adapter and Composite. The project brief was partially generated by ChatGPT, although I made my own revisions as I saw fit.

This project was designed specifically to make use of all of the design patterns listed above - this is obviously not good programming practice, as a design pattern should only be used when there is a real need for it.
